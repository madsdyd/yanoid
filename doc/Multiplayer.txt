This are some ramblings about the multiplayer aspect of yanoid

Hot seat is not considered

Q: How many players should be able to parcipitate? 2? More?
Since we have fixed maps, we need a fixed set of players.

I think 4 would be nice.


- network play

  - Cooperative 
    - multiple paddles on the same map, controlled
      by individual players.
    - Others?

  - Non-Cooperative
    - multiple paddles on the same map, controlled
      by individual players - a player loose a life, if
      he looses a ball.
    - multiple copies of the same map, paddles on each
      controlled by each player. Special bricks or 
      conditions triggered by one player can influence other
      players (ie, stealing their ball, adding bricks, etc).
