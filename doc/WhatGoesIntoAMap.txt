This is a general rambling about stuff that goes into a map.

A map consists at least of

- a size (measured in pixels)
  This is the area that the map needs to have complete control over.
  This is also the area that any ball can be within. If the whole of a
  ball leaves this area (no pixel intersection), the ball is lost.

- a description of all objects that go into the map, partitioned into
  - objects that the player must remove to finish the map
  - objects that the player do not need to remove to finish the map
  Note; objects of both categories can be added during play, this is 
  just the initial state.
  An object can be a brick, a powerup, etc, etc.

- one or more paddle paths
  A paddle path is the path a paddle can follow. (How to describe
  this?)
  For each path it may be neccesary to define a "loss" area - if the
  ball goes through this area and then falls off the map, the paddle
  on the path in question "lost" that particular ball (needed for 
  multiplayer. It is not enough to check for crossing a path, since
  we could have maps where the ball could fall off the edges, without
  crossing a path? Does that make sense?). 
  For each potential concurrently existing paths, the path needs to 
  be somehow marked as beeing a singleplayer or multiplayer path. That
  is, if the path exists in games with 1, 2, 3, 4 players.

- description of what happens each time the player restarts on the
  map. 
  This could be some special obejcts, doing weird effects, etc.

- description of what happens when the map is completed.
