The following is a list of stuff that needs to be implemented in
yanoid before the game can be considered ready for the contest. 

Bugs:

- pop sound kills music???

**********************************************************************
** SHOWSTOPPERS - MUST BE FIXED

- Collision code is flaky (JCD, is on the way)
- Autoconf code for Python 2.2b is broken (MBD)
- Complete the gameplay (map changing) code (JCD)
- More maps (BS,...)?


**********************************************************************
** IMPORTANT (or possible easy - stuff that we really should do)

* Input system - keyboard movement of paddle is not fluent (JCD)

* Menu
- Add help and about texts (JCD,MBD,BS)?

* Powerups

* Sounds (BS)
- Menu sounds 
- ball hits paddle sound
- ball hits wall sound
- ball hits brick sound
- brick effect sounds (explosion, disappear, whatever)
- powerup sounds
- bad sounds
- gem sounds

* Autotool (MBD?)
- Make sure that we fail when something essentiel is missing
- need to add libvorbisfile (-lvorbis -lvorbisfile) to configure.in
- need to add asound (-lasound) to configure.in (alsa-lib-devel)
- need to add smpeg  (-lsmpeg) to configrm ure.in
- need to add libesound-devel

The above three is probably what is needed to use SDL_mixer - so, in
all fairness, we should check the output of sdl-config and check that
each application is present or maybe we should try and build a small
SDL application that uses SDL_mixer.


**********************************************************************
** NICE TO HAVE (stuff that we may have time for)

* Graphics
- Better Font for menu/startup/display of score
- Better Paddle graphic(? Must be rectangular. After 1/12/2001 we'll see)
- Graphic for different bricks
- Ball graphic 
- Powerup graphics
- Various animation stuff 
	Level complete
	Game over 

**********************************************************************
** IN YOUR DREAMS (stuff that we will must likely NOT have time for)

* Network system 
  - (Get/deliver events/state from/to the network)

* Input system
  - mouse (probably not)
  - joystick? (very much unlikely)
