This is a mixture of bugs, wishes, tasks, etc.

TODO: Clean up this file, assign priorities and tasks...

* To compile on gcc 3.0 (and other c++) we need to use std::string or
  open the std namespace all over....(Kim Schulz)

* Add a small random angle to balls, when colliding with bricks, to
  stop never ending loops on e.g. "Diagonal Frustration".

* Fix paddle to have 3 graphics in scripts

* Ballspeed powerup

* Profile the binary

* Do not reset paddle, allow first ball to be "fired"

**********************************************************************
** CONSOLE
- Test performance
- Make page up/down keys work
- up key misses last line?
- Convert the old font?
- Strip start of currentline, before tab completion
- Don't allow the result of a tab completion to be shorter than the line
  already in place.
- Fix the speedy down go, slow up go thingy (if needed)

**********************************************************************
** SHOWSTOPPERS - MUST BE FIXED

- Make pixmap and other ressourcehandling, use a default "thingy", 
  when loads and such fails (MBD)

**********************************************************************
** IMPORTANT (or possible easy - stuff that we probably should do)

* no sounds from paddle when colliding with bricks (MBD)
- Should shots and powerups die, when the player dies?(MBD)

* Sounds (BS)
- brick effect sounds (explosion, disappear, whatever)
- sound for loosing a ball
- Game Over
- Game startup

* Pixel perfect collision detection?

* Autotool (MBD)
- Make sure that we fail when something essentiel is missing
- need to add libvorbisfile (-lvorbis -lvorbisfile) to configure.in
- need to add asound (-lasound) to configure.in (alsa-lib-devel)
- need to add smpeg  (-lsmpeg) to configrm ure.in
- need to add libesound-devel

The above three is probably what is needed to use SDL_mixer - so, in
all fairness, we should check the output of sdl-config and check that
each application is present or maybe we should try and build a small
SDL application that uses SDL_mixer.


**********************************************************************
** NICE TO HAVE (stuff that we may have time for)

* Graphics
- Better Font for menu/startup/display of score
- Better Paddle graphic(? Must be rectangular. After 1/12/2001 we'll see)
- Graphic for different bricks
- Ball graphic 
	fire
	penetrator
	"invisible"
	big
- Powerup graphics
- Various animation stuff 
	Level complete
	Game over 
- Background
	Starfield sim or so?

* Pause game on minimize (sleep to reduce CPU usage as well)

**********************************************************************
** IDEAS

- Ball on fire. Makes more damage than normal ball.

**********************************************************************
** WISHLIST

* Network system 
  - (Get/deliver events/state from/to the network)
  - commit highscore to game homepage.

* Input system
  - mouse (probably not)
  - joystick? (very much unlikely)

**********************************************************************
** PUZZLING BUGS

* The powerups passes behind bricks. This has to do with the y sorting
  of entities. Fix? <<-- Jonas may have fixed this!

* Occasionally balls will pass through objects they are supposed to 
  collide with. This appears to happen mostly when the framerate drops
  below a certain threshhold. Fix? May be OK to decrease the virtual time
  step, but it is alread quite low...

* The paddle can only collide with a single object each virtuel timestep.
  That is a problem!

* Spawned balls sometimes have a crazy speed.

* The texteffects have a bad influence on the paddle.

* The highscore class is rather impressed with negative scores... <<-- 
  Has this been fixed by Jonas???

* The highscore class seems to accept empty names, but will ignore them 
  in the list. <<-- Has this been fixed by Jonas?
