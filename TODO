The following is a list of stuff that needs to be implemented in
yanoid before the game can be considered ready for the contest. 

TODO: Clean up this file, assign priorities and tasks...

* Add a small random angle to balls, when colliding with bricks, to
  stop never ending loops on e.g. "Diagonal Frustration".

* Ballspeed powerup

* Profile the binary

* Add a statistics option to log framerate

* Do not reset paddle, allow first ball to be "fired"

**********************************************************************
** SHOWSTOPPERS - MUST BE FIXED

- Make pixmap and other ressourcehandling, use a default "thingy", 
  when loads and such fails (MBD)

**********************************************************************
** IMPORTANT (or possible easy - stuff that we probably should do)

* no sounds from paddle when colliding with bricks (MBD)
- Should shots and powerups die, when the player dies?(MBD)
- There are no background in menus (see above)... (MBD)

* Sounds (BS)
- brick effect sounds (explosion, disappear, whatever)
- sound for loosing a ball

* Pixel perfect collision detection?

* Autotool (MBD)
- Make sure that we fail when something essentiel is missing
- need to add libvorbisfile (-lvorbis -lvorbisfile) to configure.in
- need to add asound (-lasound) to configure.in (alsa-lib-devel)
- need to add smpeg  (-lsmpeg) to configrm ure.in
- need to add libesound-devel

The above three is probably what is needed to use SDL_mixer - so, in
all fairness, we should check the output of sdl-config and check that
each application is present or maybe we should try and build a small
SDL application that uses SDL_mixer.


**********************************************************************
** NICE TO HAVE (stuff that we may have time for)

* Graphics
- Better Font for menu/startup/display of score
- Better Paddle graphic(? Must be rectangular. After 1/12/2001 we'll see)
- Graphic for different bricks
- Ball graphic 
- Powerup graphics
- Various animation stuff 
	Level complete
	Game over 

* Pause game on minimize (sleep to reduce CPU usage as well)

**********************************************************************
** IN YOUR DREAMS (stuff that we will NOT have time for)

* Network system 
  - (Get/deliver events/state from/to the network)

* Input system
  - mouse (probably not)
  - joystick? (very much unlikely)

**********************************************************************
** PUZZLING BUGS

* The menu background code simply does not work on my system
  and I have no idea why. It is very simple, yet crashes frequently.
  I have ifdeffed it to hell. (mads)

* The powerups passes behind bricks. This has to do with the y sorting
  of entities. Fix?

* Occasionally balls will pass through objects they are supposed to 
  collide with. This appears to happen mostly when the framerate drops
  below a certain threshhold. Fix? May be OK to decrease the virtual time
  step, but it is alread quite low...

* The highscore class is rather impressed with negative scores...

* The highscore class seems to accept empty names, but will ignore them 
  in the list.
