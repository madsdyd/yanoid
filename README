This is the readme file for yanoid - Yet Another Arkanoid.

Currently the sole purpose of this file is to be part of the CVS archive.

Notes for the SDL contest.

Prior to configuring and installing yanoid, please make sure that you have
a dyncamic version of the Python library.

If you do not, the archive "dyn-python-lib.<date>.tgz" contains a minor
project that will create and install such a beast, from a static version
of the python libs.

Then, configure yanoid, with at least the following options:
./configure --disable-debug --enable-optimize-size
and, make and install:
make install-strip

This will ensure that yanoid is installed in its minimal form, fulfilling
the 1 MB requirement of the contest. 

Thanks.
